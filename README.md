This is a weather forecast dataset explorer java program. 

This program contains a functional GUI class that displays forecast statistics, can add to and delete from the dataset and finally a working searchbar.

It also contains a data statistics class that uses data from the dataset to perform calculations to be displayed later.

Finally it has a file processing class that reads through a dataset text file and stores the rows in a 2d array used by the other two classes.

If I had more time i would've fixed the layout of the GUI and make it look more cohesive, I would've also added more complexity to my buttons.
